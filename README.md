# MCI_Project

## Goal
In this project, a prototype for digitizing the so-called "G-Akte" is implemented.\
The current health status should be visualized as a smartphone application to the user (i.e., the patient).\
Check out our progress at https://kaimeisner.github.io/MCI_Project/. \
**Note:** This prototype aims to be displayed on a mobile device (vertical mode) which is why buttons might appear very large in the browser.
